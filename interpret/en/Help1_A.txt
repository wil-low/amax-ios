//Axes, Phases & VOC, VC,
%60%VOC — the Moon is "Void of Vourse" — the time from the last aspect till the Moon enters a sign; extremely unfavourable time.|VOC is not compensated by the presence of favourable indices.
%61%New Moon|(±2 days) from the moment of the Sun and Moon conjunction. It should be considered that the influence of New Moon begins two days before the Sun and Moon conjunction. Interpretation is bound with the date of conjunction, not with the beginning of the influence.|Then period of the Waxing Moon follows.
%62%The First Quarter|(±12 hours) the first quadrature of the Sun and Moon. The period of Waxing Moon continues.
%63%Full Moon (±2 days) from the moment of the Sun and Moon opposition. It should be considered that the influence of Full Moon begins two days before the Sun and Moon opposition. Interpretation is bound with the date of opposition, not with the beginning of the influence.|Then period of the Waning Moon follows.
%64%The last Quarter|(±12 hours) the last quadrature of the Sun and Moon. The period of the Waning Moon continues.
%65%VC — Via Combusta — "Burnt Path"|Last 6° of Libra and first 6° of Scorpio — these ranges are dark and evil, in each of them there is a fall of the Sun and Moon. One of ranges is the house of the evil planet, in another one there is an exaltation of another evil planet, and in both ranges there are Mars borders.

//Aspects, retrograding, Running 
%70%Conjunction — the aspect of mixed influence.|--|The Conjunction of planets with the Sun is specially regarded. The period of ±6 hours from the moment of exact conjunction is considered as a positive index. The rest time (±6 days) of the conjunction is considered as a negative index (the planet is burnt by the Sun). The conjunction of the Sun and the Moon is always a negative index. 
%71%Opposition — unfavourable aspect: "confrontation".
%72%Quadrature — unfavourable aspect: "difficulties".
%73%Тrine — favourable aspect: "luck".
%74%Sextile — favourable aspect: "possibility". 
%75%R — retrograde motion of the planet. Bad index for the affairs under the direction of the planet.|Doubled evil — to choose a day and an hour of retrograde rulership. For example, at retrograde Mercury the worst choice is the hour of Mercury on Wednesday.
%76%D — the beginning of the direct motion of the planet. 
%77%The Moon moving from planet to planet brings a nuance into commenced affairs. The nearest aspect towards which the Moon is directing, is important, — it forms the future of the affair started at this moment. The last aspect of the Moon before it enters another sign is the final result of the whole activity.

There is no generally accepted interpretation of m.d., moreover, in different sources discrepancies in rendering exist. |Numbering of days is bound to geographical position, because of this reason you should load the file of your or the nearest city. |The most harmonious system of moon days is Тithi of Vedic astrology. The characteristics of the days of both systems have most in common; time differs.
